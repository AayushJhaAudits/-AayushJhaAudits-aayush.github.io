      <h2>🚨 Contributing to Solmate: Adding Missing Revert Checks to ERC20 Transfer</h2>
      <p>In my journey of auditing smart contracts, I recently contributed to the Solmate library. I added essential checks for handling errors in the ERC20 transfer function. Specifically, I implemented:</p>
      
      <h3>Key Updates:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Insufficient Balance Error:</strong> I added a revert error when a user tries to transfer more than their balance. This ensures that the transfer only happens if the sender has enough tokens.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer to Zero Address Error:</strong> A revert error is added to prevent transfers to the zero address, which would otherwise result in tokens being lost permanently.</li>
        <li><strong>Gas Optimization:</strong> I used custom errors instead of strings to reduce gas costs and make the contract more efficient.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Here’s how I implemented it:</h3>

      <pre><code>
error InsufficientBalance();
error TransferToZeroAddress();

function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
    if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
    if (to == address(0)) revert TransferToZeroAddress();

    unchecked {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;
    }

    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>The code above ensures that the transfer function is safe, and gas-efficient. It also makes it much harder for vulnerabilities to be exploited.</p>
